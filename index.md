## About

- I'm going to join CUHK CSE as a Ph.D student in 2026 Fall, supervised by Prof. [Shengchao Liu](https://chao1224.github.io).

- I obtained my Bachelor's Degree of Science from School of Physics at Sun Yat-sen University in June 2025. I became a member of [PMI Lab](https://www.labxing.com/hphuang2018) and was fortunately advised by Prof. [Haiping Huang](https://spe.sysu.edu.cn/node/2338) from Oct. 2022 to June 2025.
